# What is better than some bytecode?

Here, I am trying to figure out how to compile JS to JVM bytecode (most of the ideas are stolen from Kotlin compiler).

Most likely it doesn't work at all, but building it is fun and that's what matters!

See [./asm/src/test/resources/Test.js](./asm/src/test/resources/Test.js) for the closest approximation of what works at the moment.
